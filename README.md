**Security Playbooks** is an open‑source, high‑quality cybersecurity repository featuring **MITRE ATT&CK attack simulations**, **detection engineering rules** (Sigma, YARA, Suricata), **incident response labs**, **log analysis workflows**, and **threat‑hunting playbooks**.  
This project is designed for SOC analysts, blue teamers, threat hunters, and cybersecurity who want to build real‑world skills through hands‑on examples.

## About

The **Security Playbooks** is an open-source, educational, and portfolio-focused repository for cybersecurity professionals.  
It provides a structured collection of:

- MITRE ATT&CK-based attack scenarios  
- Sigma, YARA, and Suricata detection rules  
- Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts  
- Lab walkthroughs and practical exercises  

This repository is designed to **demonstrate professional cybersecurity skills**, including threat hunting, incident response, and pentesting workflows, in a safe and controlled environment.

## Overview

**Security Playbooks** is organized to give users a clear and practical view of real-world cybersecurity workflows:

- **Detection Rules:** Ready-to-use Sigma/YARA/Suricata rules for threat detection and analysis.  
- **Scenarios:** Simulated attacks based on MITRE ATT&CK, including phishing, malware, and lateral movement exercises.  
- **Labs:** Hands-on lab exercises with PoC scripts for testing and research in isolated environments.  
- **Examples:** Sample outputs, screenshots, and logs to visualize results.  
- **Docs & Tools:** Quick Start guides, architecture explanations, and optional helper scripts to support learning and experimentation.  

## Threat Model

This playbook assumes a realistic enterprise environment and adversary behavior. It is designed for educational and lab purposes only.

- **Target Environment:** Windows Active Directory (Enterprise Network)
- **Log Sources:** 
  - Windows Event Logs (Security, Sysmon)
  - Network Traffic (PCAP)
  - Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) telemetry
- **Adversary Profile:** APT-like actor executing common enterprise attacks
- **Attack Surface:** Endpoints, domain controllers, user workstations
- **Attack Vectors Covered:** 
  - Command & scripting interpreter execution (T1059)
  - Phishing and social engineering (T1566)
  - Malware execution and lateral movement
- **Assumptions:**
  - Logging and monitoring are enabled (Sysmon, Security Logs)
  - SIEM or log aggregation is available
  - Scenarios run in isolated lab environments only
- **Goals:** 
  - Demonstrate detection engineering and threat hunting workflows
  - Provide hands-on lab exercises for portfolio and learning purposes

## Scenarios

This repository contains multiple playbook-style scenarios:

| Scenario | Type | MITRE ATT&CK | Playbook File |
|----------|------|--------------|---------------|
| PowerShell Execution | T1059 | Command & Scripting Interpreter | [T1059_PowerShell_Execution.md](scenarios/T1059_PowerShell_Execution.md) |
| Malware Analysis | Malware | Various | [malware_analysis/README.md](scenarios/malware_analysis/README.md) |
| Phishing Simulation | Social Engineering | T1566 | [phishing_simulation/README.md](scenarios/phishing_simulation/README.md) |

## Features

- MITRE ATT&CK–based attack scenarios
- Sigma / YARA / Suricata detection rules
- PoC examples for isolated lab environments
- Log analysis samples
- Threat hunting practice workflows

## Who Is This Playbook For

The Security Playbooks is intended for cybersecurity expert who want to practice, analyze, and understand real-world cyber threats in a structured and controlled environment:

- **SOC Analysts** – for detection engineering, alert analysis, and log investigation  
- **Threat Hunters** – for hypothesis-driven hunting and adversary behavior analysis  
- **Blue Team Engineers** – for building and testing detection rules (Sigma, YARA, Suricata)  
- **Cybersecurity Students** – for hands-on learning and portfolio development  
- **Red Teamers (lab-only)** – for adversary emulation and controlled attack simulations
