A comprehensive Cyber Threat Playbook providing MITRE ATT&CK-based attack scenarios, detection rules, proof-of-concept (PoC) scripts, and lab walkthroughs.

## About

The **Cyber Threat Playbook** is an open-source, educational, and portfolio-focused repository for cybersecurity professionals.  
It provides a structured collection of:

- MITRE ATT&CK-based attack scenarios  
- Sigma, YARA, and Suricata detection rules  
- Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts

- Sigma / YARA / Suricata detection rules
- PoC examples for isolated lab environments
- Log analysis samples
- Threat hunting practice workflows

## Overview

**Cyber Threat Playbook** is organized to give users a clear and practical view of real-world cybersecurity workflows:

- **Detection Rules:** Ready-to-use Sigma/YARA/Suricata rules for threat detection and analysis.  
- **Scenarios:** Simulated attacks based on MITRE ATT&CK, including phishing, malware, and lateral movement exercises.  
- **Labs:** Hands-on lab exercises with PoC scripts for testing and research in isolated environments.  
- **Examples:** Sample outputs, screenshots, and logs to visualize results.  
- **Docs & Tools:** Quick Start guides, architecture explanations, and optional helper scripts to support learning and experimentation.
