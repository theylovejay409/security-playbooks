**Security Playbooks** is an open‑source, high‑quality cybersecurity repository featuring **MITRE ATT&CK attack simulations**, **detection engineering rules** (Sigma, YARA, Suricata), **incident response labs**, **log analysis workflows**, and **threat‑hunting playbooks**.  
This project is designed for SOC analysts, blue teamers, threat hunters, and cybersecurity professionals who want to build real-world skills.

## About

Security Playbooks is an open-source, educational, and portfolio-focused repository designed for cybersecurity professionals.

It focuses on delivering realistic, MITRE ATT&CK–aligned attack scenarios, detection engineering content, and hands-on labs to help users build practical skills in threat hunting, incident response, and adversary simulation within controlled environments.

The project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world security operations by providing structured, reproducible, and practical cybersecurity workflows.

## Features

- **Detection Rules** – Ready-to-use Sigma, YARA, and Suricata rules for threat detection  
- **Attack Scenarios** – MITRE ATT&CK–based simulations (phishing, malware, lateral movement)  
- **Hands-on Labs** – Practical exercises with PoC scripts for controlled environments  
- **Log Analysis Examples** – Sample logs, outputs, and visual artifacts  
- **Documentation & Tools** – Quick Start guides, architecture docs, and helper scripts

## Threat Model

This playbook assumes a realistic enterprise environment and adversary behavior. It is designed for educational and lab purposes only.

- **Target Environment:** Windows Active Directory (Enterprise Network)
- **Log Sources:** 
  - Windows Event Logs (Security, Sysmon)
  - Network Traffic (PCAP)
  - Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) telemetry
- **Adversary Profile:** APT-like actor executing common enterprise attacks
- **Attack Surface:** Endpoints, domain controllers, user workstations
- **Attack Vectors Covered:** 
  - Command & scripting interpreter execution (T1059)
  - Phishing and social engineering (T1566)
  - Malware execution and lateral movement
- **Assumptions:**
  - Logging and monitoring are enabled (Sysmon, Security Logs)
  - SIEM or log aggregation is available
  - Scenarios run in isolated lab environments only
- **Goals:** 
  - Demonstrate detection engineering and threat hunting workflows
  - Provide hands-on lab exercises for portfolio and learning purposes

## Scenarios

This repository contains multiple playbook-style scenarios:

- Sigma / YARA / Suricata detection rules
- PoC examples for isolated lab environments
- Log analysis samples
- Threat hunting practice workflows

## Who Is This Playbook For

Security Playbooks is intended for cybersecurity professionals who want to practice, analyze, and understand real-world cyber threats in a structured and controlled environment.

- **SOC Analysts** – Perform alert triage, log analysis, and incident investigation  
- **Threat Hunters** – Conduct hypothesis-driven hunts and analyze adversary behavior  
- **Blue Team Engineers** – Build, test, and optimize detection rules (Sigma, YARA, Suricata)  
- **Cybersecurity Professionals** – Gain hands-on experience and develop practical expertise  
- **Red Teamers (Lab Use Only)** – Emulate adversary techniques in controlled, isolated environments  

## Use Cases

Security Playbooks supports a range of practical cybersecurity workflows and real-world scenarios:

- **Alert Investigation & Triage** – Analyze and validate alerts generated by SIEM and EDR platforms  
- **Threat Hunting Operations** – Execute structured hunts based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)  
- **Detection Engineering & Validation** – Develop, test, and refine detection logic against simulated threats  
- **Incident Response Simulation** – Follow structured procedures to investigate and respond to security incidents  
- **Adversary Emulation (Lab Only)** – Reproduce attacker techniques to validate defensive capabilities  
- **Training & Skill Development** – Strengthen technical skills through hands-on, scenario-based exercises
